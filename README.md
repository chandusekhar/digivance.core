# Digivance.Core Shared Library
This repository contains the public Digivance.Core library. This library can be used to interact with the
Digivance platform api's and databases. This library is actively maintained by Digivance Technologies and
is provided as open source to allow community developers to create integrations with the Digivance platform
and it's services.

For more information about Digivance and what services we provide please visit our website https://digivance.com.

## Not stable yet
We are still in early stages of building our API servers and may be making changes to the models and functionality
provided by the Digivance.Core library right now. We do not recommend building production applications based on this
version of the Digivance.Core library yet (but soon). More information, including roadmap and documentation will
be coming out Q1 of 2020, please keep an eye on us!
